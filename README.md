# excel_project_1
This is an Excel dashboard project focused on analyzing job salaries. The main goal of this project is to help job seekers explore salary ranges for various roles and ensure fair compensation.
This project was created by following a YouTube tutorial as a learning resource. I'm still improving my skills and this was my first hands-on project to practice what Iâ€™ve learned from watching tutorials and trying things out on my own.
